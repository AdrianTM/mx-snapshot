Assumptions:

original *.desktop files are in top level of git folder
name of parent folder above translations-desktop is the name of the project, at least for transifex purposes

initial setup

1.  place translations-desktop folder in top level of git repo. 
2.  run ./generate_desktop-in_files.sh to take existing desktiop files and make desktop-in files, with comments for
    translators.  files should be in the desktop-in folder
3.  run "./update-po-mo.sh pot" to generate a pot file for uploading to transifex
4.  run "./update-po-mo.sh po" to generate po files for uploading to transifex
5.  upload pot file to transifex.  don't upload any po files for a few minutes to give transifex time to process the pot file
6.  run "./get_original_strings.sh" to populate po files with existing strings from existing desktop files
7.  use "./push_original_strings.sh" to send po files to transifex.  this is destructive
    on transifex, so probably only useful when uploading initial existing translations


./get_translations will be used to update po files from transifex.
after ./get_translations, run "make desktop" to generate new desktop files and then 
copy those from the build folder to the usual place in the git repo.
make clean will remove build folder and files.

get_original_strings and push_original_strings is a one-time deal.  after strings are uploaded to transifex it should
not be used anymore.  same for updating po files.  those will come from transifex.
